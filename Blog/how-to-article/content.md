# Writing an Article

----

Writing an article is not always the easiest thing ever, and this post is no exception.

## For Starters
### General Formatting
You should always make user of headings, headings help determine different sections in your article.

> This is of course assuming you write complex articles

### Inserting Code

You can insert code by doing the following:

<pre><code data-language="csharp">// The best person class ever written
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string Lastname { get; set; }
    public int Gender { get; set; }
    public DateTime Age { get; set; }

    public Person()
    {}

    public string GetName()
    {
        return $"{FirstName} {Lastname}";
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
